# Hello-World
Hello to Github

I have started my coding since my 9th grade, since then to my 12th standard I had been a good school level programmer.
I had been practicing on Java that time.
Now when I reached college I was supposed to work with C++, but I choose Python to be my next language, and since then I am a competitive coder with python langauge.
Till now I have gained about 2 year experience with Python.
